# PetyaVaccine
Vaccine Batch file for, BleepingComputer

To vaccinate your computer so that you are unable to get infected with the current strain of `NotPetya/Petya/Petna (yeah, this naming is annoying)`, simply create a file called `perfc` in the `C:\Windows` folder and make it `read only`. I am including the text from the BleepingComputer website here as well.
